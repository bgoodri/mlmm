Description: To conduct Bayesian inference regression for responses with
    multilevel explanatory variables and missing values; It uses function from
    'Stan', a software to implement posterior sampling using Hamiltonian MC and
    its variation Non-U-Turn algorithms. It implements the posterior sampling of
    regression coefficients from the multilevel regression models. The package has
    two main functions to handle not-missing-at-random missing responses and left-
    censored with not-missing-at random responses. The purpose is to provide a
    similar format as the other R regression functions but using 'Stan' models.

Description: To conduct Bayesian inference regression for responses with multilevel explanatory variables and missing values(Zeng ISL (2017) <doi:10.1101/153049>). Functions utilizing 'Stan', a software to implement posterior sampling using Hamiltonian MC and its variation Non-U-Turn algorithms are generated and provided to implement the posterior sampling of regression coefficients from the multilevel regression models. The package has two main functions to handle not-missing-at-random missing responses and left-censored with not-missing-at random responses. The purpose is to provide a similar format as the other R regression functions but using 'Stan' models.
